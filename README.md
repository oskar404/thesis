# Reproducing: Model Based Visualization of Paper

This is my old thesis work done long ago (1994). I stumbled across the source
material and decided to check how my coding was then and if I am able compile
this.

The subject of the thesis was "Model based visualization of paper". I guess the
time has passed and the progress has made this work obsolete. Who knows I
haven't followed the progress in the printing industry.
